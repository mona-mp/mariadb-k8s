# User management RESTful API

I created a simple RESTful API  in Go for user-management in this project. I connected this application to the MariaDB cluster, which sat up in [this](https://github.com/mona-mp/mariadb-cluster) link.
I make a docker image for it and push it to my docker hub account.
And at the end, I configure GitLab CI/CD for it.

This application stores new users and their phone numbers.

**controllers**\
I have defined four handlers : \
1- GetAllUsers: retrieve the records of all the users \
2- DeletUserByID: delete specific user by ID \
3- CreateUser: create a new user \
4- UpdateUserByID: update a usersâ€™s record information

I use the [gorilla/mux](https://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux) package to implement a request router and dispatcher for matching incoming requests to their respective handler.

**database connection**\
For connecting this app to the database, there are two files:\
&ensp; 1- config.go:\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; I defined the config structure in this file, and whit the GetConnectionString function, the connectionString was created.

&ensp; 2- connector.go:\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For connecting to database i use [gorm](https://gorm.io/) which is an ORM library for Golang.\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; GORM provides CRUD operations and can also be used for the initial migration and creation of the database schema.\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;in this file i define two functions :\
- Connect: its open connection to the mysql service.\
- Migration: this function use gorm AutoMigrate function to automaticly create table.\

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; I leran about ORM technique from blow:\
